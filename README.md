## About The Project

**Direct Finds** is a front-end single-page application (SPA) that provides the user interface for a modern peer-to-peer marketplace. It allows users to browse products, view seller shops, and, for registered users, list their own items for sale.

This project was built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies to demonstrate solid programming principles without reliance on heavy frameworks. The single-page application experience is powered by the lightweight `spapp` jQuery library for smooth, client-side routing.

**Note:** This repository contains the **frontend code only**. A separate backend server is required to handle data, user authentication, and business logic.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the frontend up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser and a code editor. For the best experience, using a live server is recommended.

- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox).
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** extension is highly recommended.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-github-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
3.  **Run the application**

    - **Recommended Method (with VS Code Live Server):**
      1.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
      2.  Right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".
    - **Alternative Method:**
      Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. _(Note: Some API requests might be blocked by CORS policy with this method.)_

4.  **Connect to the Backend**
    This frontend is designed to communicate with a backend API. You will need to:
    1.  Set up and run the backend server separately.
    2.  Configure the API's base URL in the frontend code. Look for a configuration file, such as `js/config.js` or a variable at the top of `js/api.js`, and update the URL to point to your running backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api`).
