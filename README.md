## About The Project

**Direct Finds** is a front-end single-page application (SPA) that provides the user interface for a modern peer-to-peer marketplace. It allows users to browse products, view seller shops, and, for registered users, list their own items for sale.

This project was built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies to demonstrate solid programming principles without reliance on heavy frameworks. The single-page application experience is powered by the lightweight `spapp` jQuery library for smooth, client-side routing.

## DATABASE SCHEMA

</p>

This database schema powers a full-featured e-commerce web application. It allows users to register, manage their profiles, and interact with products through carts and orders. Each product belongs to a category, and users can add items to their cart before completing a purchase. Orders track all necessary details like product quantities, total amount, shipping address, and purchase-time pricing. The schema supports essential e-commerce functionality such as product management, cart operations, and order processing.
